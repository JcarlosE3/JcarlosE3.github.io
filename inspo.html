                Photography is great for when you want to create something with
                just the touch of few buttons. Its something that you yourself
                could look back on and see the memories within the image. A
                single image could have so much meaning and that just inspires
                me to keep taking photos. Im inspired to give those meanings
                into my photos. To make it really stand out and represent my
                work. Though, I am only a beginner but I will get there
                eventually. To get inspired I like to listen to music to get my
                spirit up and ready to get motivated. Then once im ready, i take
                concept and just start shooting. Drawing pictures in my head on
                how I want the photo to come out. In the end, I tend to look at
                some role models to get inspired.

                That role model is Peter Mckinnon. This youtuber was the person
                that sparked my interest in Photography to the roof. There was a
                point when all i could think about was photography and it was
                because of him. The way he explains it in his videos, makes
                photography so easy! He gets the ideas in my head to become
                something that what it is. He teaches me and keeps me educated
                on what cameras are good and what tips are good for when
                shooting outside or inside or anywhere! He is the real reason I
                continue to take photos. I remember watching one of his videos
                where he talks about making something small, so big. For
                instance, he talked about trying to take a picture of something
                outside. At first, I was thiniking "What is he even talking
                about". But then as the video continues he shows that it doesnt
                matter what the photo is about. Its about the meaning behind the
                photo. The meaning is what bring the photo to life. I went
                outside the next day to take a picture of a tent that i saw was
                outside. Now at first glance, its just a normal tent with a pool
                inside of it. Then you think about why there even is a pool
                inside the tent. It doesnt belong there. Thats not why tents are
                made and thats not why pools are made. Its about inovating and
                creating new things. It was probably just some kids thinking
                outside the box and experiementing. Especially, where I live its
                not really fancy, clean garden type area. Its about living with
                what we got. And what they had was a pool and a tent.

              <p class="text-center text-black-100">
                As for the future of photography, there will be many photos that
                people will take. There will be more great people to get
                inspired by. The future is very bright for every photographer
                because in this day of age, there are stories to be told and
                memories to be captured. Taking photos is the only thing that
                will help us remember these kinds of things. I want to rememeber
                stories I've told and there isnt any better way than to take
                photos. Its such a small thing but a big thing for time to come.
                I cant wait to look back at me taking this class. Whether I fail
                or if I pass, it wont affect me in 5 years. I will be somewhere
                thinking about something else. Memories of photos that I took
                when I was younger. Doing what I love. That is all i will
                remember and Im very happy not only for the future of
                photography but for the future of my life.
