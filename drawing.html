              <p class="text-center text-black-100">
                I started drawing since I was a little kid. Im not sure how i
                got into it, i guess one day I just started drawing and it
                became a habit. One day after another, I became a little bit
                better and I was happy just drawing whatever I wanted. I've
                always wanted to join one of those drawing contest but I never
                thought my drawings were the best. Thats why I simply do it just
                to enjoy myself. Its very relaxing and it keeps me calm. I can't
                draw without peaceful music. It has to be peaceful because it
                keeps me in my peace zone and allows me to exprees myself with
                my drawing. I havent been drawing lately, mainly because I dont
                have any more time to. Another reason though is what you will
                read down below.

              <h1 class="text-black">Why I hated drawing</h1>
              <p class="mb-0 text-black-100">
                I hated drawing at a time in my life. Thats weird, why would I
                put this under my Interest if I hate it. This is simply because
                it something that I miss and want to get back into. I want to
                trick my brain into thinking this is something that I do
                regulary on a daily basis. That way I will gain the courage to
                get my pencil and start drawing again. Back to the reason I
                hated drawing. The reason was because I didnt feel like I was
                the best. I wanted to get really good at drawing but I couldnt.
                I would see everybody else's art and I would get really jealous
                because I thought that I would never achieve something so cool.
                I wanted my art to look like their art. No matter how hard I
                tried it would always look different. This is the reason why it
                was difficult to love drawing. A lot of people will say that its
                more just of learning to respect that people take their time
                with practicing and such. They could be right but to me, I was
                hoping it was something that I was born with. It wouldve made me
                fall in love with drawing a lot more.

                To sum up this page, drawing will always have a piece in my
                heart. And I really do hope that I could respark this fire that
                I had for it. Even if I have to take some time out of my day. I
                remember before my grandmother passed away, she asked me to draw
                her a rose. I never did. Im not sure why I didnt but I wanted to
                make it up to her by getting myself a rose tatoo on my arm with
                her birthdate. This will remind me that I should never quit on
                something that I love to do. Why would that make sense? I
                couldnt live a day knowing that Im not doing something I love or
                potentially love. I dont ever want to do something like that
                because I believe that everybody should do what they love no
                matter how small it is. I will make it a goal of mine to draw
                more and keep it up until it becomes a habit and to the point
                where I believe I am happy with what I am doing.
