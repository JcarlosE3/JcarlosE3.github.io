                First of all, learning basketball by myself was tough. Its such
                an honest sport and is very simple. I enjoy wathching
                basketball, I enjoy talking about basketball, and I love to play
                basketball. Its one of the many things that I love to do and I
                will probably never get tired of it. At first it started off as
                just a thing I did in middle school to it being my one of many
                sources of happiness. I want to learn more about basketball and
                I want to make sure I end up doing something in life that
                involves basketball. I dont know how much times I have said
                'basketball' already! But that goes to show on how much I love
                it! A quick story, I remember trying out for the team in middle
                school and I had got cut. It tore me to pieces because I really
                wanted to play. That day I got cut I worked on every single
                thing until I perfected it. Now whatever I do, if i fail, I go
                back and keep doing that certain thing that I failed and perfect
                it.

              <p class="mb-0 text-black-100">
                Now there is always a debate on who the greatest basketball
                player out there is. I personally think every players has a
                unique type of play style. But it will always come up on who I
                believe is the greatest to ever play the game. Before I would
                always say Lebron James. He does many great things off the court
                and thats why I admire him. He is the king of basektball today
                and will forever go down as the greatest of all time. Now, ive
                changed my mind and now believe Michael Jordan is the greatest.
                Not only does he have 6 championship rings, but he has never
                lost a finals game. He was one of the first basetkball players
                to wear his own shoes and has changed the game from what it was.
                He made it look so easy, and I will forever look up to him.
                Another great basketball player is the late Kobe Bryant. I was
                sad when I saw that he had passed away. He was one of the
                reasons I started playing basektball. He is the legend of
                basketball and you cant talk about basketball without ever
                mentioning his name. R.I.P to the legend Kobe Bryant no. 8/24
