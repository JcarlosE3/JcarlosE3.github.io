              <p class="text-center text-black-100">
                Last summer, in 2020 in the jist of the whole Covid-19, I did
                not have a job and was just going to school. I felt pretty
                miserable that I didnt have my first job. I did have one job
                before but I wasnt motivated. This time I was very motivated to
                get a job. To get that work experience and get out there and try
                something new. So I started applying for jobs. I applied for so
                many jobs and I really tried my best to find any job that would
                hire me. That is a lie, I did apply for jobs but I wasnt happy
                because I felt like those types of jobs werent for me. I didn't
                think the work force was for me. That is why I went to school.
                Anyways, after all the jobs I applied for, only 2 jobs came
                about. One for gamestop(ideal because I love Games) and
                Chipotle. I went to both interviews and didnt get a single call
                back. I was pretty bummed until my old friend from high school
                gave me a call. He asked if I was looking for a job and I said
                yes. Its like it was meant to be because it was all perfect
                timing. I never felt so happy to work and get out there in the
                work field.

              <p class="mb-0 text-black-100">
                I was scared on the first day of work. I had no clue what I was
                doing becasue I went from playing videos games everyday to using
                tools I never used before. I didnt do much on my first day and
                to be honest, I was thinking about quiting because of how hard
                it was. If it wasnt for my friend/coworker 'Adrian' I wouldve
                left, He took me under his wing and taught me everything he
                knew. He helped me grow and become more confident in myself.
                Today, I am working and installing floor for this company. I am
                only a helper but I like to think of myself as a home remodler.
                I still have much more to learn and Im sure there are more
                challenges to come but look at me so far, I never thought I
                would be installing floor but here I am. Its truly a blessing in
                my life and with the pandemic going on and people losing their
                jobs Im forever grateful that I got this job and I am working.

              <p class="text-center text-black-100">
                As for the future of my Job, I look forward to learning
                everything that has to do with flooring. Its going to take time
                but once Im ready I will be joining my friend Adrian to his
                company and becoming a full time installer. At that point I will
                feel proud of myself for ever making it that far. I will be
                grateful for ever meeting my friend and I will be grateful for
                this Job and respect it so much more. Flooring is a big job and
                when you are helping people remodel their house to how they want
                it, it just makes it so much better. I hope to continue making
                people happy with the floor and continue living my life knowing
                that it couldve all never happend. At that point, I will always
                be grateful.
